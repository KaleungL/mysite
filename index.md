<h1>Hello!</h1>

<p>
  I am a Research Fellow at Monash Centre for Financial Studies (MCFS). 
</p>
    
<p>
  MCFS is one of the cross-disciplinary research centres within Monash Business School, Monash University. 
  We execute policy and industry relevant research related to the financial sector.
</p>
  
<p>
  My research areas include finance, macroeconomics and labour economics. 
</p>
    
<p>
  Currently, I am particularly interested in banking organisations and their role in the broader economy. 
  I study why banks thrive or fail, how they respond to policies and regulations, and how their behaviour affects the wellbeing of individuals, households and firms. 
</p>
  
<p>
  Prior to joining the Centre in August 2024, I obtained my PhD in Economics from Princeton University.

    <b>Banks' Geographic Expansion: New Location, Same Old Neighbours</b>
    <br>
    <button class="collapsible"><font size="-1">Abstract.</font></button>
    <div class="abstract">
    <p><font size="-1">This paper explores how frictions in lending relationships affect banks' geographic expansion. Leveraging the US interstate banking deregulation as a natural experiment, I find that banks are more likely to expand to new locations with a stronger presence of "familiar" firms. These firms already operate in the bank's original neighbourhoods. This finding is consistent with bank-firm lending relationships being local and persistent. Furthermore, the statewide deregulation does not benefit all regions and firms equally. Areas with more "familiar" firms experience more bank entries and higher economic growth. Small businesses do not grow as fast as large firms. These findings highlight the potential limitations of banking deregulation in generating economic growth and provide guidance for more effective and equitable financial reforms.</font></p>

    <b>The Financial Transmission of Trade Shocks: Household Credit Channel</b> 
    <br>
    <button class="collapsible"><font size="-1">Abstract.</font></button>
    <div class="abstract">
    <p><font size="-1">Banks can transmit trade shocks across regions and from tradable to non-tradable sectors. This paper studies the response of US banks to the increase in import competition in the local economy due to China's accession to WTO. I find that exposed banks experience slower growth in deposits and contract their household lendings. Regions with greater reliance on lending from exposed banks have slower employment growth in the non-tradable sectors.</font></p>

    <b>Capital Injection: Live Long and Wither</b>
    <br>
    <button class="collapsible"><font size="-1">Abstract.</font></button>
    <div class="abstract">
    <p><font size="-1">This paper studies the effects of government bailouts on banks' survival during the crisis. I find that US banks who received capital injections from the Treasury's Capital Purchase Program had a lower failure rate than the non-recipient. However, the rescuing effects dissipate shortly after the peak of the crisis. Meanwhile, capital recipients also had a substantially higher chance of being acquired, possibly due to political pressures and management inefficiency, resulting in a higher overall exit rate.</font></p>

<h2>Teaching Experience</h2>

<p><i>At Princeton University, I served as teaching asssitant for the following courses:</i></p>

<ul>
  
  <li>
    <b>ECO362 Financial Investments</b>
    <br>
    <button class="collapsible"><font size="-1">Description.</font></button>
    <div class="abstract">
    <p> <font size="-1">This course is an introduction to financial investments for students with no prior knowledge of finance. It provides an overview of financial markets and instruments including stocks, bonds, futures, options, and other derivatives. A theory of optimal asset allocation teaches the tradeoff between risk and return and the importance of diversification. A theory of asset pricing, developed under the assumption of no arbitrage, is used to evaluate trading strategies and the performance of mutual funds and other asset managers. Key concepts are illustrated through examples and homework exercises that use financial market data.</font></p>
